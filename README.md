# LABS FOR DATA-REPRESENTATION
Module -> 52957 : DATA REPRESENTATION

## 1. XML HTML and DOM        
Create a html page called carviewer. In this html file, include a create button, a table & a form. Also include bootstrap in order to use CSS.

  - View all the cars R
  - Update a car      U
  - Delete a car      D

## 3. HTTP and Web Scraping
Extract house prices from myhome.ie and store in a TabSV

## 4. JSON, AJAX & REST
  JSON
1. Create a file called Lab01-simpleJSON.html.
2. Write the code that will convert the following JSON into a javascript object,
3 In a file called Lab02-json-array.html. Write the code that will convert the
  following JSON into a javascript object (array)
  
  AJAX
4. Write a web page (Lan03-ajax-readsimple.html), that uses AJAX to read the JSOn
   from the website https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json
5. Modify the webpage to output the euro rate for bit coin to the page, you will
   need to look at the JSON that the page returns and work out what you are
   looking for
6. Modify the code to print out the US dollar rate and the British pound rate

## 5. AJAX and REST
1. In	this	lab	we	will	make	some	CURL	commands	on	the	command	line
2. Get a web server to run :
  • Create a simple app-server with flask
  • Serve static web pages
  • Get pre-written REST-server to run (and test it with curl)
  • The server serves out a RESTfull api that performs CRUD operations on cars
3. We	want	to	make	the	AJAX	calls	that	will	call	the	RESTful	API
  • The	server	serves	out	a	RESTfull	api	that	performs	CRUD	operations	on	cars
  
## 6. Using python to consume APIs
1. In	this	lab	we	are	going	to	use	Python	to	access	the	server	we	used	in	week05	via	the	API
2. We are going to use Python access APIs that need a key
      We are using the APIs as described by:
      • https://html2pdf.app/
      • https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/
3. we are going to use the package PyGitHub to interact with github
      It is easier than making all our own requests;
      Install using
      Pip install PyGithub  
      Documentation on this package:
      • https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html
      For examples
      • https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html
      Full reference
      • https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html
      
## 7. Consolidation 
1. Read	data	from	an	API	that	does	not	require	authorization.
